# Spell-Checker

This spell checker takes in two text files, a dictionary and a file to be spell-checked. The spell checker will find incorrect words and make suggestions on how to fix them by adding/removing a letter or by swapping two letters. The spell checker is implemented using a vector, set, and unordered set. The runtimes for all of them are printed to the screen, showing how the set and unordered set are much more efficient than the vector.
